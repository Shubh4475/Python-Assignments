The access modifiers are public, protected, and private. Application of these types of modifiers control how access to an object's internal state is achieved.

        "A method resolution order lets Python define a search path up in an inheritance hierarchy. In simple terms, we can say that it guides Python when it needs to find a method in case of a call on an object. It becomes very useful in the case of multiple inheritance whereby a class inherits from more than one class. Using MRO, Python can determine the order of calling methods from base classes ensuring that the method that is supposed to be called is selected.\n",

        "1. Python uses a depth-first search to look for methods in the class hierarchy.\n",
